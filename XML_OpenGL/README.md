Example-Based Generation and Automatic road and pavement modelling for the simulation of inhabited virtual environment 

Collaborative Research Project by Edina Morris and Matt Skellon

Our system requires boost to run.

To use system:

1. Download a map selection from OpenStreetMaps.org and save on your system
2. Run program, click open file and navigate to map data
3. Wait for the system to parse and display the network and then click generate road network for the extended version. We generate the extended version by analysing the original network and creating rules based on it
4. Switch between the original and extended network using buttons provided
5. Output the road network as an obj file, the data gets saved to map.obj in the output folder
6. Load in the obj file into a modelling software program of your choosing
